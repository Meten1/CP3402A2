Deployment Overview:
This website is for a learning center called Baizonn. It is mainly about Baizonn's introduction, such as business concept, audience, school address and booking schedule.
We mainly use Wordpress to edit the website, and we will use some plug-ins to improve the website. And we will keep the website updated.

Applications and Processes:
We used discord to communicate and upload our thoughts and design ideas as a backup for future updates.
We use Figma in the design. Figma allows us to experience the website more intuitively when it is not finished, so that we can better modify and add new ideas.

Theme Development:
We use a blank template in Wordpress so that we can better add our own ideas without being restricted by the template.
The main color of our website is white, which can make our website look more simple and intuitive, so that users can find the content they need in the first time. And the target audience of our website is mostly young people, the use of light colors appear more vitality. Since using only one color was too monotonous, we added blue to make the site look livelier and match the color of the Baizonn logo.

Hosting and Deployment：
AWS: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a widely adopted cloud platform created by Amazon. It offers a large number of different hosting instances for different environments and hosting needs. In this project we used AWS to host our Dev and Prod WordPress sites using Lightsail instances loaded with Bitnami's Wordpress Installer. We chose AWS because it is the world's most "comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform" and is a relatively inexpensive option for what we needed for this project. You can find information on AWS here: https://aws.amazon.com/. The development site's admin control can be accessed at https://dev.moxh.au/wp-admin/ (you will need to be provided a password) and the production site can be found at https://moxh.au/wp-login.

Project Management：
Github is a wildly used platform for developers to build, share and maintain software, code, applications, and more. In this project, we used Github to host a repository for all of our code and resources and to maintain detailed version control of the changes we have made throughout the project.
Discord is a place to collaborate and communicate with team members. You create servers to suit your purpose and create channels within servers to separate and organise your work. You can chat, post images, pin messages, and store files with Discord. For this project , Discord was used because many of the group are already a part of other Discord servers and it would have greater visibility than slack for our purposes.
